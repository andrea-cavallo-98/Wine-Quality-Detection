# Wine-Quality-Detection

### Steps to follow
* Perform proper data visualization: already present plots, identify outliers (maybe box plots)
* Try out all the imported models, paying attention to all possible hyperparameters and improvements
* Use different evaluation techniques

### Various notes
* Support Vector Machines have quite a bad performance, find a way to improve them
* GMM is the best performing model so far
* LDA performs bad as a technique for classification
* **Finish logistic regression**
* REMEMBER TO CHECK IF CENTERED FEATURES MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE!!:
    * for Gaussian models, no difference if features are z-normalized or not
